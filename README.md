# HOBBIES AND INTEREST
I am an art lover. I love all forms of art let it be music, sketching, etc. I know how to play tabla and piano. I have competed in Cricket, football, taekwondo, roller skating, badminton and Ultimate frisbee competitions. I sometimes pencil sketch in my free time or practice my instruments. When I am outside, scenic views and wildlife compels me to pick up DSLR and click some shots. Competitive coding helps me to get my brain  working. I have 300 points in problem solving in HackerRank.
